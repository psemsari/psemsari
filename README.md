## Hello, my name is Pierre. 👋

I am a web dreamer who is passionate about technology and its potential to advance organizations, individuals, and society as a whole. 

My goal is to *create* or *educate* people about the digital world, using code and math to build beautiful things ✨. 

I learned to code at [School 42](https://www.42.fr/) and started coding during my high school studies. I have always searched the internet to learn more and now I want to achieve big things. 

I plan to utilize **AI** and graphic technology, exploring web 🌐, mobile 📱, and cloud ☁️ platforms to accomplish my goals.
