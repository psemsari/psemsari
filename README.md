## Hello, my name is Pierre. 👋

I am a *web dreamer* who is passionate about technology and its potential to advance organizations, individuals, and society as a whole. 

My goal is to **educate** people about the digital world and use code and math to **build beautiful things** ✨. 

I started coding during my high school studies and learned to code at [School 42](https://www.42.fr/). I have always searched the internet to learn more and now I want to achieve big things 🚀. 

I plan to use **AI**, **graphic technology**, exploring **web** 🌐, **mobile** 📱, and **cloud** platforms ☁️ to accomplish my goals.
